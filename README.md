#### About Reinforcment Learning

`Science of the decision making.`
 
 RL is used in:
 - Machine Learning
 - Optimal Control
 - Reward System
 - Operations Research
 - Bounded Rationality
 - Classical/Operant Conditioning
 
 ###### What makes reinforcement learning different from other machine learning paradigms?
 - There is no supervisor, only a reward signal.
 - Feedback is delayed, not instantaneuous. Results are are always tested
 retrospectively to tell if they were a good ones or bad ones.
 - Time really matters where data is sequential, and it doesn't matter 
 if the data is i.i.d.
 - Agent's actions affect the subsequent data it recieves.
